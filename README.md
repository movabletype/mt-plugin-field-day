## Overview

FieldDay is a plugin for Movable Type that lets you add more fields to the MT
interface.


## Features

How is Field Day different from MT's built-in "Commercial Pack" implementation
of custom fields?

* You can define fields for templates, assets, comments, and blogs, as well as
  system-wide fields.
* Linked object field types let you connect any supported object type to any
  other.
* By organizing fields into groups and allowing multiple instances of each
  group, you can allow users to associate an unlimited amount of data with a
  given object.
